# Powershell-Koans

Coding koans in Powershell. Microsoft's favorite shell isn't just for automating the company's products; it is also a general purpose scripting language.  Learn the ins and outs of the language in fun, bite sized bits.

#To Get Started

Fork, clone or download this repo to a machine with Powershell. I'll assume you're on Windows 7 to keep things simple. If you're downloading the zip I recommend you unblock the file.

Fire up a Powershell console and launch `run.bat` or `src\contemplate_koans.ps1`. The output on the screen will point you to one of the files in `src\koans\` where something needs fixing.
